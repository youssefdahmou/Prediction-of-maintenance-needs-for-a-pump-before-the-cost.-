# Prediction-of-maintenance-needs-for-a-pump-before-the-cost.-
in this project the aem was to predict the failure of pompe before it happens based on it's envirement caractiristics in  order to avoid the fianancial cost .


## The initial stages of this project involved :  
      performing exploratory data analysis.
       preprocessing the data.
       selecting relevant features.
       selecting appropriate models.
       and constructing models.
       
## To identify the most suitable algorithms for the model, I experimented with 30 different classification algorithms. I also applied clustering techniques to predict the number of potential failures.


## However, there was an issue with unbalanced data, which I resolved by using the oversampling method and reapplying the 30 algorithms.
